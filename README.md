 Notes  
- Backend is based on Java EE web technologies (likely using JSP/Servlets).  
- You must import the project into NetBeans or configure Apache Tomcat/GlassFish to run it.  
- Create the database by importing the SQL dump file `hotel_information_system.sql` into MySQL.  
- Pages are located under `build/web/` and include HTML forms connected to backend logic.
